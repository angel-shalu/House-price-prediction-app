# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project demonstrates House Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.
The goal is to predict house prices based on features such as square feet (sqft living), floors, bedrooms, and other attributes.
The app is built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, and the models are saved using Pickle for deployment.


📌 Features

✅ Simple Linear Regression – Predicts price using only sqft_living
✅ Multiple Linear Regression – Uses multiple features like sqft_living, floors, bedrooms, etc.
✅ Interactive Streamlit App for real-time predictions
✅ Models saved and loaded with Pickle
✅ Easy-to-use interface for users
